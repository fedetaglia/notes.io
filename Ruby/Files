CREATE NEW FILE

f = File.new("students.txt","w")

OPEN EXISTING FILE FOR READING
f = File.new("students.txt","r")


READ EACH LINE AND PUT INTO ARRAY
students = f.readlines
after that you have to take away the "/n" after each element
students.map {|s| s.chomp}


RETURN ONLY ONE LINE EACH TIME  
variable = f.gets

------ 

WRITE INTO FILE
f = File.new("students.txt","w")

f.puts "something else"
everything was into the file will be deleted


f = File.new("students.txt","a")
f.puts "something"
"something" will be added at the end of the file


f.flush
-------

WRITE AND READ

f = File.new("students.txt","w+")
but it will delete everything as fist action

f = File.new("students.txt","r+")
it will no cancel everything you have already done previously!
it will start from the top of the file

f = File.new("students.txt","a+")
it will no cancel everything you have already done previously!
it will start from the bottom of the file


OPEN

File.open("students.text","r") do |f|
  students f.readlines.map {&:chomp}
end

CLOSE FILE
f.close

save an array into the file

s.each {|s| f.puts s}
